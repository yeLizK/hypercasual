Hypercasual game is created for Mastered Bootcamp Creative Live Challenge 4

The task was creating an hypercasual game in just under 6 hours. I decided to create a game where you need to find the character in the scene by looking at a referenced visual. The referenced visual is hidden at first and it reveals in time. The faster the player finds the character, the more points he will get.
